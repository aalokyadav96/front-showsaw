Here‚Äôs a breakdown of your two questions:

---

### üîç **Search Bar Placement ‚Äî Inline vs. Separate Page**

**Recommendation: Put the search bar *on* the events listing page.**

#### Why?
- **Faster access**: Users expect instant filtering without changing pages.
- **Better UX**: Real-time filtering or auto-submission gives quicker results.
- **Standard practice**: Most ticket platforms (Eventbrite, BookMyShow) use inline search with filters.

#### When to use separate search page (like Twitter):
- Only if you expect **complex, full-text search across many domains** (e.g. tweets, users, hashtags).
- For events, this is unnecessary unless you're combining blog posts, creators, and tickets in one search feed.

### ‚úÖ Implementation Plan for Your New Features

Here‚Äôs a roadmap for the features you mentioned:

---

#### 1. **QR Code Generation on Ticket**
- Use a library like `github.com/skip2/go-qrcode` in Go.
- Embed the QR code in the PDF (`qrcode.EncodeToPNG(...)`, embed using `gofpdf` or similar).

#### 2. **Custom Ticket PDF Design**
- Use `gofpdf`, `unidoc`, or HTML to PDF service (e.g., wkhtmltopdf).
- Structure: event info, attendee info, ticket ID, QR code.
- Make layout modular (template-like) so you can support different themes later.

#### 3. **Admin/Scanner App or View**
- Web view: Create a `/scanner` route with a simple camera-based QR scanner (use JS libraries like `html5-qrcode`).
- Mobile app (optional): Use webview or a PWA with same QR logic.
- Scanner endpoint: `GET /verify-ticket?code=...`, respond with valid/invalid and ticket info.

#### 4. **Bot/Spam Protection**
- Add **honeypot fields** in forms (invisible fields bots fill, humans don‚Äôt).
- Rate-limit API calls like ticket verification, PDF download, login.
- Add **reCAPTCHA v3** or hCaptcha where high abuse risk exists (signup, checkout).

#### 5. **Support for Both Offline & Online Verification**
- Online: scan QR and verify against backend.
- Offline: QR code should contain encrypted/encoded data (e.g. ticket ID + HMAC).
- Scanner app can verify offline using shared secret or public key to validate HMAC/signature.

#### 6. **Abuse Handling**
- Track ticket usage: log when and where a ticket was scanned.
- Set ticket status: unused, scanned, revoked.
- Allow admin to view abuse reports, mark tickets as blocked, regenerate.
